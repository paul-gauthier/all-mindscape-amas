Buckle up. So say if we take the cat out of the thought experiment, Schrodinger's cat, and focus instead on what is going on with the atoms. We have a machine which randomly selects a single atom from a sealed box containing many identical radioactive atoms. The machine takes a reading at the exact point of the atom's half-life. If it is decayed, then a macroscopic event A is triggered, like a bell is rung. If it is not decayed, then macroscopic event B is triggered. A firework rocket goes off, let's say. I would argue, says Felix... that the atom which is selected from the container is special in some very particular way. It alone, among all the atoms in the room, is able to impact the wider world around it. Each of the macroscopic events in question could have occurred spontaneously without any intervention from the machine, but the chances of that so happening are extraordinarily unlikely. If I can apply a version of what I understand to be your explanation of the multiverse theory, the rules have been rigged so that the universe can split into only one of two outcomes\u2014 each of which was always possible, but neither of which would have otherwise been expected to occur. The laws of physics ascribed to the atom are exactly the same as for those left behind in the container, but the selected atom is special in a very remarkable way. It has been given, in effect, agency to choose which event will occur. This agency comes not from anything particular about that atom, but rather from the structure of all the other atoms around it, the machine, the bell, the firework, etc. If we are prepared to make this leap, then the same agency could equally be ascribed to the structure of the atoms inside the human brain, albeit on a much more complicated level. I may perhaps be restating the problem of consciousness, but it seems to me that the above perspective provides a route by which the purely quantum properties of a particular atom or other subatomic particles can reach out to influence and perhaps even be said to communicate with the wider macroscopic world.", "fingerprint": "qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqAIwoVM0+Ko8cvY0akYx2BU0PBsyRBIwoAIwiDEQiEb7K7GmQ6ZgvCgldDCRQ3bp5m/dr25FqtTW/hbzx9VD/+5Jk2Qj0WTzMS5k="}

I don't think that you should be guilty about your pleasures. Just enjoy your pleasures as long as you're not hurting anybody else. So I'm not that guilty about my pleasures. I'm in favor of pleasures as a general rule. People should have more of them. And presciently, you put your finger on one of my main pleasures, guilty or not, which is mechanical watches. You know, 10 years ago, I had no interest in mechanical watches. I was happy to wear a cheap electronic watch. But then I wrote a book called called From Eternity to Here, The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time. And it was mostly about the entropy and the arrow of time and a little bit about space-time and time reversibility, as we've been talking about, stuff like that. But, you know, it was my first trade book. I was very enthusiastic about writing absolutely everything that could be thought of and said about this topic. So I did a little bit about timekeeping in the book. And I started reading up about escapements and things like that. And somehow I actually got started reading about the Swiss, the quartz... crisis in Swiss mechanical watches. For those of you who don't know, you know, it used to be that mechanical watches were the only watches. Those are what you had. And then in the late 60s, in the 1970s, they invented quartz watches, which are much cheaper and more accurate, right? So that's a win-win,naudible? And for, to a large extent, the Swiss mechanical watch industry cratered the quartz crisis, it's called, because why would you spend more money on a watch that is not as accurate? And finally, they figured out a reason to stay alive. And the reason was that it's kind of nice to have an elegant mechanical machine on your wrist that serves both as a technological marvel and as a work of art. as a little bit of jewelry, right? Men don't get to wear jewelry. They don't get to adorn themselves with accessories that often, but watches are one way that you can do it. So these days, there's a whole mechanical watch industry, and the price points go from $100 to a million dollars, more than a million dollars for the super expensive watches. And they're both, they really are technologically quite impressive. Many of them, you know, depending on how much you're willing to spend, they're mass produced. But at the higher levels of paying, you're looking at things that get a lot of individual human attention along the way. Some of them are interesting in their designs and some of them are beautiful and some of them are just kind of like rugged and manly or elegant and artistic and beautiful. And so it is it's a wonderful hobby to kind of get lost in. In fact, it's very, very dangerous hobby because however much money you want to spend, you can't. So you have to keep that under control. happily for me, I'm not really a spendthrift. I'm not really, you know, someone to spend more money than I have or want to feel comfortable spending. So I'm not in danger of, you know, buying $100,000 watches, even if I could. I don't think I ever could. Could you ever buy?za\u0107 I know people do, but, like, could you walk around with a $100,000 watch on your hand worried that, like, it might break? I don't know. I don't think I could ever be rich enough to enjoy that. But I like... the level of, of, uh, spending that I can do on it. I try to restrain myself from, from buying too many watches. I went through a phase early, like where you buy a lot of cheap watches because just one variety. And now I realize it's better to save your money, get a nice watch whenever you want one and completely, you know, completely guilty pleasure in the sense that it's not practical. I can still check the time on my phone just as well, but I like it. That's what a guilty pleasure is. I just like it. That's the point. But the real answer to your question is, of course, as many people know, is basketball. Like if you folks knew how many minutes of my average day was spent thinking about the Philadelphia 76ers, you'd be embarrassed for me. You would feel bad. You would\uaca0\uc5b4 You know, I talk about lots of things on the Internet and so forth. When I'm reading things on the Internet, a lot of the time it's about trade scenarios for the Sixers, et cetera. And, you know, at the end of a long day, if there happens to be a Sixers game on, I'd be very happyaven though they're very far away. Technology lets me watch the games now. It's kind of awesome. Um, again, completely impractical, but pleasurable. And I think that's good. I don't think that you should be, you should feel guilty about it at all. So pleasures, let's just call them pleasures. And let's say that pleasures are good things. And with that, I cannot think of a better place to wind up this Ask Me Anything episode.
