That's capital I equals tilde capital X. In logic, that tilde often would mean not, but in physics or math, it might mean approximately equal to, so I'm not quite sure what is being meant here. Anyway, the question continues. I've learned that in physics, capital I stands for electric current, which in turn is a stream of charged particles. I find that heuristically, the Lorentz force formula... I equals Q, the electric charge, times E plus V cross B. That's correct. No, actually, that's not correct. Sorry. That is the force for the, that is the, I'm in the middle of Samson's questions here. Maybe let me finish reading Samson's question. Could we describe a dual entity, a body and a contingent mind, with the electrical term describing the current conducted by a neural network, System 1, and the magnetic term describing the induced current by an emergent magnetosphere, like the B-field, System 2. For me, Q moves, therefore B, B feels I, I feels B. I therefore feel that I am. And to paraphrase Einstein, questions as to the seat of the self have no point.
