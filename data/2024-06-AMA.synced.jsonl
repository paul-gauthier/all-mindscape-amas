This was a common... topic this week, and for very good reasons. A goon in the gooniverse says, when a physics student starts out, they learn about particles. In grad school, they find out particles are actually excitations in fields, and fields are fundamental things. Feynman gave us a way to understand field interactions using particle-like pictures, but it's all field theory. Similarly, when a student opens a textbook on string theory, it will begin by minimizing the action of a string's world sheet. But what are the underlying objects in string theory? Are strings like more complicated vibrations in a field, or is it something else? Chris Mason says, I have listened to Mindscape for a number of years and watched all the biggest ideas in the universe video series. Looking back, I am delighted with how much I have understood, including a popular level understanding of quantum field theory. However, listening to your latest podcast on string theory, I realized it is not clicked for me where string theory fits in with quantum field theory. If string theory turns out to be correct, does that mean QFT is wrong? Or would it be better to think of QFT as a limit of string theory in a particular regime? And finally, Connor says... most succinctly, which I am in favor of. Everyone who can write their questions succinctly, please try to do that.
