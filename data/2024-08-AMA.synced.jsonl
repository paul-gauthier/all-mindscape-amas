The picture of gravity as the curvature of space-time as encoded in the metric tensor is the classical way. of talking about it. If you want to imagine that you've quantized gravity, then gravitons are the individual small particle-like excitations of that quantized metric. It's always difficult. It is possible, and you can do it, but it moves against understanding things better in the direction of making things harder than they need to, to take a static force field and think of it as a collection of particles, okay? That is just as true for electromagnetism as it is for gravity. Can I take the electric field around an electron and think of it as a collection of photons? The answer is you can, but it doesn't illuminate anything, and it makes things much harder to understand in many different ways. So don't think of the force of gravity as due to gravitons. I mean, it is the... Sorry, I should back up. Don't think of the macroscopic, everyday gravitational force that you're familiar with as being due to gravitons. You're allowed to think of it that way, okay? If you were thinking of two particles scattering off of each other by exchanging a single graviton, that would make perfect sense.

When you talk about the history of the measurement problem, I realized something I'd never thought to ask about. If the Schrodinger equation was developed before the Born rule, how did physicists make sense of it before they had a way of assigning probabilities? Before there was a connection between the wave function and some sort of physical measurement, why would anyone have thought that the equation or even the concept of a wave function was useful or meaningful?", "fingerprint": "CMZhIG155I46rA4abhBLRcWGTb+XJ/tj5f8jpIFYapSm60eNTFwZvjEFxc8+KcfFf8c8XNtvpnjw//uSZOAM9F1JTJt4QnAAAA0gAAABFlGVKi4wd4AAADSAAAAElDoJBQLBU8Ti7JLx3P1LlClFzr90pQsEgPiMIkT9pQfg0D8="}
