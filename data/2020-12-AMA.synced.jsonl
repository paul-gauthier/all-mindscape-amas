So as we've already said in the AMA, we don't know whether the universe is infinite or finite, okay? Even if the size of our observable universe was the size of a grapefruit almost 13.8 billion years ago, the universe itself might have been infinitely big at that time. And it's certainly at least, you know, again, as far as we know, it was not that there was matter in in a grapefruit-sized region of space and then empty space outside. That's conceivable. You can imagine that. But we have zero reason to think that's how it was. So the universe could be closed. That is to say, it could be the three-dimensional version of a sphere. And then it could literally have a finite size. And that size could be that of a grapefruit. But it wouldn't have any middles. There's no middle to a sphere because when we say in math or physics, when we say the sphere, we mean the surface of the sphere. So the surface of a two-dimensional sphere has no middle. What you're thinking of as the middle is inside and that doesn't count. That's not part of the sphere. And the universe could be a three-dimensional version of that. So it could be a closed, positively curved, three-dimensional manifold that is spherical in its geometry, but again, nothing in the middle.
