Why don't we see dark energy and effects in galaxies themselves?

They're long questions. James says, I haven't quite wrapped my mind around the need for a past hypothesis to explain the arrow of time. If I zoom out and look at the model of the universe as a whole, it seems that simply having a boundary condition at the Big Bang, along with the second law, is sufficient to result in a model of the universe where entropy increases when moving away from that boundary condition. And the entropy will be low by definition at that boundary. Am I thinking about this wrong? Mat, mat, mat, three mats in a row is the... person's name. I have a question about your thoughts on time direction and Landauer's principle. Landauer's principle, by the way, parenthetically, is what attributes a growth of entropy when you erase some bit of information in a thermal bath. So the question continues. Supposing that the erasure of a memory increases the entropy of the relevant system, what does this mean when we choose to describe things in the opposite direction of time? Surely we say that towards the past memories are erased, but that there is not an accompanying increase in entropy. Should we say that Landauer's principle only applies to the future? And finally, Nick Shorten says, I've heard physicists talk about the time reversibility of the laws of physics and the linking of the arrow of time with entropy. In many worlds where the Schrodinger equation is presumably time reversible, the splitting seems to only go one way.

The catch is that one has to dedicate one's life to such a pursuit. And another catch seems to be that the said truth is claimed to be only expressible via metaphors and eludes a direct and precise description. However, from all accounts, the nature of the truth that one discovers is is not just deeply gratifying and beautiful, but also largely consistent, as can be evidenced from the similarity in the writings of those who are believed to have done a particularly good job of walking these disciplines.
