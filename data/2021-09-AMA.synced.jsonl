Per Magnusson says, you've said many times that the presence of gravity made the entropy at the Big Bang low. Can you give an intuitive explanation for how gravity has this effect? Reiner Gl\u00fcger says, is entropy not just an epiphenomenon of sufficiently complex systems and hence not very fundamental? It may, for example, not be reasonable to speak about the entropy of the early universe if there were not enough degrees of freedom to apply an entropy concept. John Bergmeier says, when you discuss the early universe having low entropy, how is that possible?

Nate Wadoops says, in your conversation with David Wallace, you said, it truly blows my mind that even to this day, the reason why ice cubes melt and don't unmelt has something to do with what was going on 14 billion years ago at the Big Bang.
