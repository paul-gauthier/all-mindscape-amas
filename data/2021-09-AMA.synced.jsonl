Per Magnusson says, you've said many times that the presence of gravity made the entropy at the Big Bang low. Can you give an intuitive explanation for how gravity has this effect? Reiner Gl\u00fcger says, is entropy not just an epiphenomenon of sufficiently complex systems and hence not very fundamental? It may, for example, not be reasonable to speak about the entropy of the early universe if there were not enough degrees of freedom to apply an entropy concept. John Bergmeier says, when you discuss the early universe having low entropy, how is that possible?

Nate Wadoops says, in your conversation with David Wallace, you said, it truly blows my mind that even to this day, the reason why ice cubes melt and don't unmelt has something to do with what was going on 14 billion years ago at the Big Bang.

This is why Schrodinger's sleepy, wakey cat is already decohered long before we open the box. The information about the cat leaks through the walls of the box within a microsecond of when the superposition is first established. My question is, can there conceivably be anything that we can make the box out of so that the information doesn't leak out? Does nature allow decoherence shields? Um...

As I understand it, space begins to expand at t equals zero uniformly everywhere. Therefore, it seems like every particle of matter or dark matter would, from t equals zero, effectively move away from every other particle in the universe. As space expands between them, the gravitational attraction between every particle in the universe should also get weaker.
