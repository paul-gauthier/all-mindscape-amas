So it's good that you put yourself out there the first time. The question is, suppose I'm a working physicist waiting for an atom to decay. The probability of the atom to decay will increase as time passes. What happens according to many worlds? Does an infinite number of copies of me split as I wait, since as time passes in each fraction of a second there will be a different universe in which the atom might decay? Then another related question comes from Krzysztof Pieronski, who says, I am almost able to imagine and believe a finite or countably infinite number of my versions in the universe.

Furtenbach fired a cannon straight up into the air and stood calmly by the muzzle as the cannonball went up into the air. He expected the motion of the rotating earth to cause the ball to hit the ground some distance to the west of his position. as he told onlookers if he was incorrect the ball would instead come down on his head killing him the story goes that the cannonball did in fact hit the ground and form a small crater to the west of the cannon not killing him presumably an amazing story but it did prove did it prove the motion of the earth or was furtenbach just lucky unless my understanding of physics is way off wouldn't a cannonball fired in a perfectly perpendicular direction to the surface of the earth be expected to land in the same spot from which it is fired, barring other forces such as wind.", "fingerprint": "UYydjBOeElQtZXIjAppESNe1jr3/tu5603tFeGp0ewCWJY6A2HwMltj5Je3bPdH+m2TcqK1/vsy3rVD+K+z2EkqP0KKntXpumcI95FVMQU1FMy4xMDBVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVQAAaAACmJGAAp5yoChk7lSGuAwVh8eSmGw="}
