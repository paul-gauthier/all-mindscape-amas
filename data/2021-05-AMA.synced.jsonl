So it's good that you put yourself out there the first time. The question is, suppose I'm a working physicist waiting for an atom to decay. The probability of the atom to decay will increase as time passes. What happens according to many worlds? Does an infinite number of copies of me split as I wait, since as time passes in each fraction of a second there will be a different universe in which the atom might decay? Then another related question comes from Krzysztof Pieronski, who says, I am almost able to imagine and believe a finite or countably infinite number of my versions in the universe.
