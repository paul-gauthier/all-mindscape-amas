After some time, I turn the robot off, copy its memory banks perfectly to the robot in room 2 with a memory stick, update the position, etc., turn the room 2 robot on. From the robot's perspective, nothing interesting happened, and he would only be surprised to find himself in room 2 after opening the door. You might argue this robot only thinks he's the same robot in room 1, but his feeling of self... meets the same standards as those of you calling yourself of several days you. At least this is what functionalism assumes. Now I repeat the experiment. It's a long question. Sorry, folks. But instead of only switching on the robot in room two, I switch on both robots simultaneously. And I tell them the trick that I pulled. Now both robots will be unable to tell me with certainty in which room they are. Does this mean that from their perspective, they are either the robot in room one or room two and they just don't know? Or... They're in a sort of limbo of which robot they are. While the first option seems intuitive, it implies that somehow during the copying, a choice was made, but the data on the memory stick is always the same as in the first experiment. If the choice was made when the robots were turned on, why not 10 seconds after they were turned on?

Light, time, and even space itself are evidence strongly suggests this way. The idea that reality is a consciousness-driven digital construction rather than a simulation\u2014 has its followers and some very persuasive arguments to support it. Given that there undeniably is something rather than nothing, it is the simplest explanation. The initial Big Bang theory was seductively simple and intuitive, but when cosmic inflation and quantum theory reared their ugly heads, that simplicity went right into the dustbin.
