That seems conceptually very different from the idea that gravity is a force mediated by an elementary particle called the graviton. How should we think about the relationship between these ideas? Sean Atkinson says, I understand we are confident that gravity must be communicated via an additional quantum particle referred to as the gravitino, and it's just a matter of discovery. But I've also heard on multiple occasions that gravity is not so much a regular force, but rather how space-time is curved. These explanations have always felt like some kind of contradiction. Am I missing something? And Anonymous says, I have a question about what it means for space to be curved. If I put a cantaloupe on an empty cereal box, the, that's a very specific analogy by the way, but if you put a cantaloupe on an empty cereal box, the surface of the box will bend inward and curve. But I could still think of the box as curved with respect to rigid three-dimensional coordinates.
