That seems conceptually very different from the idea that gravity is a force mediated by an elementary particle called the graviton. How should we think about the relationship between these ideas? Sean Atkinson says, I understand we are confident that gravity must be communicated via an additional quantum particle referred to as the gravitino, and it's just a matter of discovery. But I've also heard on multiple occasions that gravity is not so much a regular force, but rather how space-time is curved. These explanations have always felt like some kind of contradiction. Am I missing something? And Anonymous says, I have a question about what it means for space to be curved. If I put a cantaloupe on an empty cereal box, the, that's a very specific analogy by the way, but if you put a cantaloupe on an empty cereal box, the surface of the box will bend inward and curve. But I could still think of the box as curved with respect to rigid three-dimensional coordinates.

So the lack of libertarian free will can be re-expressed as saying that human beings are just obey the laws of physics, okay? We have no way of being a law unto ourselves. Just being a person and an agent does not give us in any sense the ability to override what the rules of the core theory tell us that our atoms and particles should be doing. That's non-libertarian free will. So what is the alternative? I mean, we call it libertarian free will, but what does it mean really? Like, what would it be? Does it mean there are other equations that govern the choices people make, but they're not the laws of physics? Does it mean that there are no equations at all? And what would that mean? Like, even if human behavior was unpredictable... presumably you could still come up with a probability measure and say, well, there's a probability that certain things happen and a probability that they don't. Certain actions are taken by certain agents and conscious creatures. After all, that's just what we do in quantum mechanics, right? We still call it a law of physics. So I'm a little concerned that there isn't any good definition of what you would mean by libertarian free will. But it doesn't bother me that much because I don't believe in libertarian in free will so i'm kind of not worried about this it reminds me of when we had back in 2012 when i organized the moving naturalism forward workshop and so the idea was get a bunch of naturalists in the same room and rather than debating with theists or religious people try to work on the questions that we had amongst ourselves which are multiple and people got stuck right at the beginning trying to find what naturalism is and i was like you know don't don't spend our time doing that because it is hard to define, but it's only hard to define because you don't know what supernaturalism is. Like naturalism makes perfect sense. There are laws of physics and there's stuff and it obeys the laws of physics. That's naturalism, right? Supernaturalism is hard to define, but who cares? We're naturalists. We don't need to worry about that.

So the lack of libertarian free will can be re-expressed as saying that human beings are just obey the laws of physics, okay? We have no way of being a law unto ourselves. Just being a person and an agent does not give us in any sense the ability to override what the rules of the core theory tell us that our atoms and particles should be doing. That's non-libertarian free will. So what is the alternative? I mean, we call it libertarian free will, but what does it mean really? Like, what would it be? Does it mean there are other equations that govern the choices people make, but they're not the laws of physics? Does it mean that there are no equations at all? And what would that mean? Like, even if human behavior was unpredictable... presumably you could still come up with a probability measure and say, well, there's a probability that certain things happen and a probability that they don't. Certain actions are taken by certain agents and conscious creatures. After all, that's just what we do in quantum mechanics, right? We still call it a law of physics. So I'm a little concerned that there isn't any good definition of what you would mean by libertarian free will. But it doesn't bother me that much because I don't believe in libertarian in free will so i'm kind of not worried about this it reminds me of when we had back in 2012 when i organized the moving naturalism forward workshop and so the idea was get a bunch of naturalists in the same room and rather than debating with theists or religious people try to work on the questions that we had amongst ourselves which are multiple and people got stuck right at the beginning trying to find what naturalism is and i was like you know don't don't spend our time doing that because it is hard to define, but it's only hard to define because you don't know what supernaturalism is. Like naturalism makes perfect sense. There are laws of physics and there's stuff and it obeys the laws of physics. That's naturalism, right? Supernaturalism is hard to define, but who cares? We're naturalists. We don't need to worry about that. I feel the same way about libertarian free will.", "fingerprint": "sPVC7mndEdaW1ir50jUfUPEqTXrvEKxK9fxf8Xcf6IXUbGpyk9VMQU1FMy4xMDBVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVAYAAICJjd0mmACZKNBkEFngdKYIB5jFuDoU="}
