There's also a cause-and-effect asymmetry, where, from the perspectives of people and other agents of change, an agent's action cannot change the past but can change the future. It seemed like the point there was to say that one asymmetry implied the other. But unfortunately, I just don't see any good reason why the two asymmetries should be related at all.

It's a little vague to say there are opinions that it is wrong. I'm not quite sure what that refers to. It's clearly wrong in that it's incomplete, right? There are particles other than the ones that are described in QED. Strictly speaking, QED is the theory of photons, electrons, and positrons, and that's it, right? Electrons, anti-electrons, and the photons that give forces between them. That's the original definition of QED. So if you believe there are neutrinos and quarks, if you believe there's the strong interactions and the weak interactions, then QED is wrong. But really, we don't usually say... it's wrong, we say that it's just part of a bigger structure. Electromagnetism has become unified with the weak interactions and the electroweak theory. We also know there are the strong interactions and so on. Maybe all three of those forces are unified in grand unification, but we just don't know right now. There's another sense, a much more subtle and interesting sense in which QED might be wrong. When we understood finally, you know, it wasn't until the 1970s we really understood quantum field theory. And part of that understanding was renormalization group flow. So renormalization has this reputation as being about hiding infinities, okay? And it was originally. That was in the 40s and 50s, the idea that we had infinities in quantum field theory. We had to get rid of them. We renormalized them. But it was understood much better through the work of Wilson and previously Gelman and Lowe and Kadanoff and others in the 60s and 70s, where we understood that renormalization is really a way of looking at physics at different scales, including the effects of different processes at different energy and time and length scales. So what Wilson in particular was able to show is that you can take a quantum field theory and and cut it off, you can say, I'm just not going to include effects above a certain energy scale. And because energy is inversely proportional to length, that's like I'm not including effects below a certain wavelength. And you might say, well, who chooses that wavelength? That sounds important. You're just arbitrarily cutting off your quantum field theory. And the renormalization group is a way of dealing with that, of saying, I can choose whatever cutoff I want. to not include processes of very high energies", "fingerprint": "t6LyQaboCauSERpHV0kTQKbcESSMqLP2SpxFmpXLoLsKkYchjEEjYOFSNOr2sQhDqc/0bZ3H/qVeQEzxp1hrjXJCXHZ3V1W3AUPUMBI6soYC5Dzbhtd7/08NwPWjroKmglxa1NKptwo77SX0h+kwzfyGKWBn4v3asppsbs9dsV4="}
