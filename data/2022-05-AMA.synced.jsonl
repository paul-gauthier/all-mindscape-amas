It's a little vague to say there are opinions that it is wrong. I'm not quite sure what that refers to. It's clearly wrong in that it's incomplete, right? There are particles other than the ones that are described in QED. Strictly speaking, QED is the theory of photons, electrons, and positrons, and that's it, right? Electrons, anti-electrons, and the photons that give forces between them. That's the original definition of QED. So if you believe there are neutrinos and quarks, if you believe there's the strong interactions and the weak interactions, then QED is wrong. But really, we don't usually say... it's wrong, we say that it's just part of a bigger structure. Electromagnetism has become unified with the weak interactions and the electroweak theory. We also know there are the strong interactions and so on. Maybe all three of those forces are unified in grand unification, but we just don't know right now. There's another sense, a much more subtle and interesting sense in which QED might be wrong. When we understood finally, you know, it wasn't until the 1970s we really understood quantum field theory. And part of that understanding was renormalization group flow. So renormalization has this reputation as being about hiding infinities, okay? And it was originally. That was in the 40s and 50s, the idea that we had infinities in quantum field theory. We had to get rid of them. We renormalized them. But it was understood much better through the work of Wilson and previously Gelman and Lowe and Kadanoff and others in the 60s and 70s, where we understood that renormalization is really a way of looking at physics at different scales, including the effects of different processes at different energy and time and length scales. So what Wilson in particular was able to show is that you can take a quantum field theory and and cut it off, you can say, I'm just not going to include effects above a certain energy scale. And because energy is inversely proportional to length, that's like I'm not including effects below a certain wavelength. And you might say, well, who chooses that wavelength? That sounds important. You're just arbitrarily cutting off your quantum field theory. And the renormalization group is a way of dealing with that, of saying, I can choose whatever cutoff I want. to not include processes of very high energies", "fingerprint": "t6LyQaboCauSERpHV0kTQKbcESSMqLP2SpxFmpXLoLsKkYchjEEjYOFSNOr2sQhDqc/0bZ3H/qVeQEzxp1hrjXJCXHZ3V1W3AUPUMBI6soYC5Dzbhtd7/08NwPWjroKmglxa1NKptwo77SX0h+kwzfyGKWBn4v3asppsbs9dsV4="}

The steampunk example appears less direct. It's not so much the knowledge that moves the weight as what the experimenter does with that knowledge, and the effort required of the experimenter requires additional work input that seems more directly tied to the weight movement than the knowledge does.

One is from Phil, who says, do you think there's value in making the basic math of physical theories more constructive slash computational? Right now, a lot of it builds on things like the real numbers. Their whole existence is not proven constructively, and only an infinitesimal fraction of them are computable. This seems like a bit shaky as a foundation. And then Rolo Berges says, this is a question I've been thinking about since coming across an observation in Scott Aronson's book, Quantum Computing Since Democritus. Basically, mathematically, the set of computable numbers is a subset of the reals of measure zero. This means that if the universe is continuous, almost none of its states can ever precisely be calculated using any set of physical laws. The laws must be continuous, but our calculation procedures can only yield computable answers. Aronson thinks this point makes it seem likely the universe isn't truly continuous in a mathematical sense. Do you think this kind of point is potentially sound or flawed in some way?
