For a normal irreversible event like a glass shattering on the ground, the bound up energies dissipate into sound and motion and heat. We could imagine precisely that same form of energy conspiring to arrive at just the right moment to reinvigorate the glass and put it back on the table. Not impossible, just discountably unlikely. Can such a thing be true for a book falling into a black hole? Can some conspiracy-minded forces arrive at just the right time to let us see the book spontaneously arise from the event horizon? This gets described as impossible in popular literature, not merely unlikely. Do we need Hawking radiation to make this happen? You could have Hawking radiation spit out a book. It's super duper unlikely, but there's a probability that's going to happen, and you could calculate the probability. But that wouldn't be what you're thinking of. The issue is that in a black hole, as you make the black hole, there is already a time orientation to the event horizon. The outside of the black hole is in the past of the event horizon, and the future of the black hole is in the future. So it's not like glass shattering on the ground there really is a boundary a barrier that separates the past from the future in the black hole what you can do is imagine time reversing the whole shebang and then you get a white hole and a white hole is also an event horizon where the interior is in the past and the exterior is in the future and it would spit things out Would those things being spit out be very, very low entropy, et cetera? That is harder to say because in the real world, there aren't any white holes out there. But the Big Bang is kind of like that. The Big Bang is a low entropy singularity in the past. So there's some commonalities there.
