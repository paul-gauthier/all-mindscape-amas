This gets described as impossible in popular literature, not merely unlikely. Do we need Hawking radiation to make this happen? You could have Hawking radiation spit out a book. It's super duper unlikely, but there's a probability that's going to happen, and you could calculate the probability. But that wouldn't be what you're thinking of. The issue is that in a black hole, as you make the black hole, there is already a time orientation to the event horizon. The outside of the black hole is in the past of the event horizon, and the future of the black hole is in the future. So it's not like glass shattering on the ground there really is a boundary a barrier that separates the past from the future in the black hole what you can do is imagine time reversing the whole shebang and then you get a white hole and a white hole is also an event horizon where the interior is in the past and the exterior is in the future and it would spit things out Would those things being spit out be very, very low entropy, et cetera? That is harder to say because in the real world, there aren't any white holes out there. But the Big Bang is kind of like that. The Big Bang is a low entropy singularity in the past.

The idea that any perspective of cosmology depends on who's looking got me thinking about an alien's eye view in your session with Arik Kirschenbaum. How different could an alien physics or cosmological theory be given that they are looking at the same universe but perceiving it very differently, eyes that see a very different frequency of light or so forth?", "fingerprint": "+xYszh9Q0YHTFtUzBIJlHA2LvIB+HR+IaOEcikWQbjHzUooeAiHTDucHmAcYrvBv0N9iEELFAAoDApNtqmkAAB4ExACE0HbmssmqIWTxhMboW8N6IHGmeWWvChidJatE4xAC/RvRFyUf3WaxSuXJCnThbD1Rx0nEcJjhzl8N9ic="}

If we measure the position of... approaching exactly in principle, what prevents the particle from traveling outside of the light cone in the next instant?", "fingerprint": "DygWBAYwSOEM9A01cDPpgNaMAIClEujPLcSAT6JSD8jErmajUtlYfCY0RAYG4i8OeMyXhtkWMQxqTZeItWoxMGaXnoqatVQNolwpEWRRROESHUkx9Tp1qUpanLqTGi00VsrWpN0kEUkKbN///+gVzpf////NlGxVCJKK1R0cS2E="}
