And Bits Plus Atoms says, I heard Brian Green interview Roger Penrose, and Penrose says, paraphrased, an intensity versus frequency graph of the CMB is almost identical to the Planck curve representing blackbody radiation. That curve represents thermal equilibrium for a system. This would suggest that at the birth of the CMB, the universe was in a state of thermal equilibrium, but it wasn't.

The quark model sounds a bit like a collection of spin one-half fields for which up to three particles can occupy a given state, rather than the usual zero or one for fermions because of the Pauli Exclusion Principle. There is a color charge taking one of three values that provides an additional quantum number to distinguish the states, but you can never isolate a quark and determine if its color is the same or different from another's. The gluon fields basically exist to guarantee symmetry among color assignments. Would such fields behave fundamentally differently from the quark-gluon model if not forbidden by the spin statistics theorem?", "fingerprint": "3mHiJ6iwkhxWiKE6FhEoQ9ckikfGidkyRHSE+jeFycLEqwrXJXFLoMKo14CZhRk62FyRgjOKuFbCFwpxChI3ESYORiVTJxQgmFnQLQnRlHrGjNTPIuowVIRnjbs5bispw5Nm44wIzABhSAYMQBJsPGUwfAtIbXKBhd0FVFjQn1k="}
