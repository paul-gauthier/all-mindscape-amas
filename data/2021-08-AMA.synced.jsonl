This reminded me of Carl Friston, who has identified a model for biological systems based on his free energy principle, another previous Mindscape guest. The model identifies internal states, external states, active states, and sensory states that operate to minimize the difference between a known internal state and a Bayesian predicted external state. A cell membrane may simply be an evolved way to limit the computational bandwidth needed to process the model algorithm by reducing the number of internal state variables.
