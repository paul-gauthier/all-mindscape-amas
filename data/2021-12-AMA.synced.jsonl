Oh, many of you know, I should have mentioned this, but in case you didn't know, I did a podcast, a long podcast with Philip Goff and Keith Frankish. Philip, of course, has been a Mindscape guest before. He is a promoter of panpsychism in the theory of consciousness. And Keith is on the opposite side of the consciousness debates. He's also a philosopher. He's a proponent of illusionism. He doesn't think that qualia in the strict philosophical sense are even real. They're just illusions. So we talked about Why I'm a physicalist about these things. And it was a useful conversation. We talked about zombies a lot. And I wrote a follow-up blog post on the zombie argument for physicalism, if you're interested in that. So this is partly what is instigating these questions. So one is from Keith. I don't think it's Keith Frankish. It's a person named Keith. who says, I enjoyed your blog post on pea zombies for physicalism and visit on MindChat. MindChat is the name of the podcast, and pea zombies are philosophical zombies. So for those of you who don't know, a pea zombie is the idea that we could imagine exactly two different, again, two different possible worlds, one of which I have real human beings and they have all their conscious experiences and all this stuff, the real world as we think and we know it. But I also, according to this thought experiment, could imagine a different possible world made of the same kinds of matter right, same kinds of quantum mechanics and electrons and protons and neutrons, et cetera, obeying exactly the same laws of physics, doing exactly the same things, but no consciousness, okay? And the people who live in that world, I would call them zombies. And so, sorry, I'm departing from Keith's question here, but I'm giving you background if you don't already know. So the zombie argument is the idea that because in principle I can conceive of the same exact physical collection of matter with and without consciousness, consciousness must be something other than some way of talking about the physical behavior of that collection of matter. Of course, I would say that that's begging the question. because you can only conceive of those zombies if you believe that consciousness is not physical. If you believe that consciousness is just an emergent thing to talk about, describing the underlying physical behavior of matter, then you cannot conceive of zombies because the same exact physical collection of matter, behaving in exactly the same way, would be conscious under that definition. Okay, that is the argument that goes back and forth. So Keith's question is, I followed up the reasoning for most part, but I really get hung up a bit upstream. As a fellow physicalist, I don't really get how a pea zombie is even conceivable, or maybe my notion of conceivability is too strict. And then another question from Graham Clark that says, do you think that a philosophical zombie is actually conceivable? Your arguments against panpsychism seem to indicate that, but I wonder why the zombie concept hasn't been rejected.", "fingerprint": "MI5eAHDDPZS+iEo9IVUBVMCyiMp4S2akczWoozLLTpRj1mQIKi2xhQWdMqYJOcQaTEjCjkKnwCwNMIGiqkqbvJ46YQd9VjPxF0qKh+AaQRwHcxBsVjkT0UA/L1IqHB0EBoIwenyEFyADYEiJMrY/xxmS4KkMtBuvFPHQZkkki1U="}

If our current formulation of quantum mechanics hasn't appeared to answer what happened at or before the Big Bang, the black hole firewall, and singularity questions, is it better to think of the wave function as a complete description of quantum mechanics? Or... that it needs to be modified to account for these mysteries. You know, so good. This gets to the issue of quantum mechanics as a framework versus a theory. You know, quantum mechanics is not a theory. of physics. It's a framework in which you develop theories of physics, just like classical physics is not a theory all by itself. You can have the classical theory of gravity, of electromagnetism, of the simple harmonic oscillator, whatever. Likewise, you have the quantum theory of simple harmonic oscillator, electromagnetism, gravity, whatever. You have different versions of all of these different specific theories, classical versions and quantum versions. So when you struggle to understand some particular quantum mechanical phenomenon, it is possible to ask, you know, is this a case where it's not just we haven't found the right model within quantum mechanics, but that quantum mechanics itself is not up to the task? Maybe. I mean, in some sense, that's what Stephen Wolfram would say, right? If you remember our podcast with him. I don't see that at all. I think that quantum mechanics, number one, there's no experimental problem with it at all. In other examples of times where we've had to throw out a theory or improve upon it, there's always been some experimental evidence that it wasn't quite fitting. But number two, I don't think that we've tried hard enough. Like, it seems to me to be extremely premature to say, well, we haven't quantized gravity yet, therefore quantum mechanics is wrong. We just haven't tried hard enough to quantize gravity, honestly. Like, I know there's a lot of people out there working on quantum gravity, but most of them are still starting from some classical theory and trying to quantize it, right? I don't think that taking the quantumness of it seriously has been tried nearly hard enough. So that's why I am not in favor of doing that. Quantum mechanics as a framework is extremely robust and successful. And there's also the small data point that people have tried to change it and failed. It's really, really hard to modify quantum mechanics in a way that doesn't immediately run afoul of something you know about the world, like, you know, the speed of light limit or something like that.
