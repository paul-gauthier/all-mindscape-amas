Coyne says, if sex is a spectrum and not binary, then people of different genders can somehow feel that they are in harmony with biological reality. But that's an example of the appeal to nature.

Sadly, the system is non-proportionate, but the fringes are deregularized. Or sorry, are regularized. I think that what Henry means is the 3% who end up in the 100 citizens are not going to have a big voice. He continues, I agree. Think a diet lottery system could improve the tone of politics because it would be a waste of time for a candidate to rally her base and get out the vote under this system. This is because the voting population, the random sample, will exhibit 100% voter turnout. So getting out the vote is just not a thing.

That is a question you can ask, and that is what you were talking about. But the theory choice question about doing an experiment to prove the past hypothesis is not that question. That's just calculating the likelihood function, right, in Bayes' theorem. To choose between the theories, you have to multiply that likelihood function by the prior. So the question is not given this theory, what do you expect to see next? But given what you see, what is the most likely theory, okay? And given a universe that is randomly fluctuating, it is true that given what we see now, the next thing we should see is just some thermal equilibrium random fluctuations.
