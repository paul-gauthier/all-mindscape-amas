They seem to feel this distinction is more than just semantics. Coyne says, if sex is a spectrum and not binary, then people of different genders can somehow feel that they are in harmony with biological reality. But that's an example of the appeal to nature.

Think a diet lottery system could improve the tone of politics because it would be a waste of time for a candidate to rally her base and get out the vote under this system. This is because the voting population, the random sample, will exhibit 100% voter turnout. So getting out the vote is just not a thing.

Sean explains that distinguishing between predicting future observations and choosing theories requires Bayesian reasoning, emphasizing the need for the past hypothesis due to the overwhelming improbability of random fluctuations explaining observed phenomena.", "question_index": 29352, "llm_found_question": "Kevin O'Toole says, Our experiences are explained by a small world fluctuating from equilibrium and by illusory stuff outside that world just enough to make us think that the universe is bigger and explain what we've observed so far. All that's true, but it does not get you the result, Kevin, that you want to get because you have to distinguish between asking, given this universe, in other words, a universe where there really just are random fluctuations and we don't have the past hypothesis, what would you expect to see next? That is a question you can ask, and that is what you were talking about. But the theory choice question about doing an experiment to prove the past hypothesis is not that question. That's just calculating the likelihood function, right, in Bayes' theorem. To choose between the theories, you have to multiply that likelihood function by the prior. So the question is not given this theory, what do you expect to see next? But given what you see, what is the most likely theory, okay? And given a universe that is randomly fluctuating, it is true that given what we see now, the next thing we should see is just some thermal equilibrium random fluctuations. But given that the next thing we see is not thermal equilibrium random fluctuations, if that universe were real, it would still be overwhelmingly likely that all that stuff had just fluctuated into existence, okay? So that's why you need to assume the past hypothesis. You can't actually be a good Bayesian and rule it out by data because under that set of assumptions that all configurations of stuff in the universe are equally likely, the prior probability that you're seeing things randomly fluctuate into existence is so unlikely overwhelmingly large that you can't beat it down just by likelihood functions and collecting new data.", "fingerprint": "4go+0h34w8rpP8wp1pQw50IrLrliQV5Z9atfmI5PSukz1dt3u5yO1fxuW79POXItTvs78Wdp3ZXO0kouoIZHLWETTJU6vSkuaLIW0M1tKqED5ic5MqUbbRaTmXT/+5Jk8oD19W1Bq3hJ8AAADSAAAAEVYbELLTDRiAAANIAAAAQ="}
