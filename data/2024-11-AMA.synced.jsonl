Since the subjective experience is a computation, then we take the sufficient number of people to simulate this computation. Each one will receive a number on his or her smartphone, make the appropriate computation in an old calculator and output the result by sending a text message to its connections, which are also people receiving numbers in their phones. Will this system have the subjective experience of an image?", "fingerprint": "zL9Zw+qxZezh2IGeN4I8/EomFTSKG3aWijgiEsI50Mv+oeyqOsLYcya2yhAMik11yYQzWTqCOWo8wyuxddjB2UQ8wJkaTTKYhhCp156lNG3je5IuLNDjcLrxkaIUhKLYTBWEIRGxXUDoTSRtWCOOZ2UT2p2YG1jRW2IRhqlTZeI="}

A multi-billionaire has developed and implemented a scheme to seed the atmosphere with sulfur. The sulfur creates sulfur dioxide high in the atmosphere which in the story reflects sunlight thereby countering the effects of greenhouse gases. He is convinced that governments will dither forever about global warming so decides to try to fix the problem on his own using his own resources. But of course, there may be side effects of his atmospheric tampering which he understands but believes is a price that must be paid if Earth is to be saved.
