Newton unintentionally showed that this model was hopeless.

What Newton showed is that we can understand a theory but not what it means. Thus the question of motion was abandoned and science reduced its goals to finding intelligible theories. This was the correct thing to do and now the same should be done for consciousness. We can find out more about it and develop theories but we should abandon the idea of solving this current hard problem.

This will be the last question of the AMA from Rafael Rusitska. And it is, I thought a lot about this one recently. If increasing entropy is a fundamental feature of time itself, higher entropy equals more configuration possibilities, meaning chaos. Humans emotionally yearn for some form of the easier, more structured, less chaotic ordered life. aren't the laws of nature itself against this emotional want, and we need to accept that everything, I mean everything we take for granted, will at some point become more unstructured and chaotic, and will we need to develop ever more capabilities of dealing with ever more interdependent chaos centers?", "fingerprint": "MBkKMaZEhxyOGgCEzL00LAAKWAEbGFgqA8iFjAQCBRE3AAQxAZuwVBH2dmKNmqmhxgyRYzxo7ScYNA6kbBKY4uBkrnmUCI4IOQg3kcEiFFaFxnPlDpyFpdDbayzmVRbCNRpp//uSZLAABx1T0b5rQAIAAA0gwAAAHJ09Q/m9AAg="}
