I had thought that the thermodynamic basis of the formation of complex molecular structures, as explained by former Mindscape guest Jeremy England, was fairly well established. That is, in my own understanding, in an open thermodynamic system, like the surface of the Earth, where septillions of atoms and molecules collide more or less at random and with varying levels of energy, sometimes old chemical bonds are broken, sometimes new bonds are formed. But any molecular structure whose formation in such a collision entailed the dispersal of some amount of energy as heat is less likely to be reversed by a subsequent collision in proportion to the amount of energy dispersed.
