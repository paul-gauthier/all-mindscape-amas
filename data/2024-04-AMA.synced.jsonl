Let me mention, let me pause for a second to mention that Patreon supporters, who are, of course, the ones asking these Ask Me Anything questions\u2026 Actually, I didn't even mention that, did I? By the way, the Ask Me Anything questions are asked by Patreon supporters and you could be one of those Patreon supporters. I'm supposed to give this sales pitch every time. Just go to www.patreon.com and you can sign up to be a supporter of mindscape dollar an episode or however much more you want to give you get ad-free versions of the episodes as well as the ability to to ask the ama questions And I've been experimenting with this idea where after every regular podcast, not the AMAs, but regular podcasts where I'm interviewing somebody, I do a little five-minute reflection video where I just talk about, you know, my immediate in-the-moment impressions of how the conversation just went, you know, ideas that come to mind after having that talk. So, yeah. If you listened to the podcast I did with Sahar, and this was just referenced in a previous question, but there is a particular idea in physics that I had a conviction for a long time must be relevant to thinking about society and, you know, the emergent behavior of human beings. And that is, of course, the idea of a phase transition, right? Right. It's sometimes talked about in the social context as a tipping point. When you go from being in one phase to being in another phase, like water turning to ice or to water vapor or what have you. Fine, that's pretty easy and that's pretty straightforward. But there is a specific quantitative feature of physics-based phase transitions, which is critical or scale-free behavior. That is to say, something is going on at all different length scales. If you have the Ising model or water boiling or whatever, when you are exactly at that phase transition point, there's activity at very, very small scales and at very, very large scales. And on either side of the phase transition, you will generally get either nothing but large-scale activity or nothing but small-scale activity. It's really at that critical phase transition point where the activity is going on at all scales. And so Sahar mentioned that... This is a feature of networks of information flow in human societies that are able to enact \u2013 enact? Is that the right word? To generate social change, that there are both sort of tightly knit people and also more weak bonds to broader people throughout the community more generally \u2013 If you have only one but not the other, if you have only weak connections to a large number of people or strong connections to a small number, you're less able to get real social change happening than if you have both. So I thought that was an interesting connection. Anyway, I talked about that in the reflection video for Sahar's episode. So Paul continues. He says, \"...it seems that the human brain is capable of capturing structures of arbitrary scales in its connectivity and electrical activity.\" i.e. knowledge about particle physics, astrophysics, or for that matter, society. Could this sort of scale freeness be related to the critical brain hypothesis? More generally, it seems that our universe has to allow structure to transcend the scale for anything interesting to happen. Has this been shown to be a property of the laws of physics?", "fingerprint": "x6FbVKxCVjgKLC8DFYBDxf+RMSWohOFgCOAEObUuBCWxzTxz/Ib+s/614/koun7W5IaQezSoE9mVzYWOMSIf//uSZP+O9X1HSwu4e1YAAA0gAAABG10tMk9p7YAAADSAAAAEgWoYjOSuVlW9KA/kIZm/HPQwliKfVRLw1yUWoZc="}
