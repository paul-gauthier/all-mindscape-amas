I make a tiny bit of effort if I don't recognize someone's name from previous AMAs. I try to give them a little bit of preference. I'm not very good at that. It's not at all systematic. I'm sorry if you've been asking questions and have never gotten one through. My apologies for that. But I do try to spread the wealth a little bit. And the other is I will reiterate the instructions. Number one, keep your questions short. Number two, only one question per AMA. So there's some folks in there that seem to have not noticed those instructions. But those instructions help you get a question answered. Anyway, neither one of these apply to these questions. I don't know why it just came up into my brain right now. But Fabian says, I recently thought of the fact that when I do something good for a future person, like future me\u2014 I'm actually doing something nice for an incredibly huge amount of future people on different branches. Somehow, it's made it even more enjoyable to do something nice, like cleaning the house for my future selves. Have you had any philosophical realizations or something similar from this way of trying to understand the self in the context of a branching universe? And the other question is by Gauta Einival, who says, Are believers in the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics faced with different ethical considerations than believers in one-world interpretations? It seems to me that my relationship to a future version of me on a different branch resembles my relationship to a person living today that I will never meet. And if so, I would think the joy of dodging a bullet\u2014 that could be set up by having a lucky draw of a quantum process using the Universe Splitter app\u2014 should be diminished by the fact that another person on a different branch was hit by the bullet.
