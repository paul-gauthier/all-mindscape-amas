I am trying to understand the science of climate change, the potential harm, and what can be done about it. To do this, I read books, watch the news, read summaries of climate reports, etc. So when I come across a book like Unsettled by Stephen Kunin, I am left wondering, is climate change politicized and sensationalized enough that it will never be realistically understood enough by the layperson voter? I would summarize the main takeaway of Kunin's book, as a need for us to be more careful about what the science says, and in particular, with what uncertainty and not broadcast headlines that are far from what the data really say.
