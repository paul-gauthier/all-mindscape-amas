You can go to bold.org slash scholarships slash Mindscape. That's B-O-L-D dot org.

And we're aiming at people who are interested interested in the big ideas, right? Not necessarily practical things. There's a lot of doctors and lawyers out there. That's great. We're aiming at people who are trying to think about physics, philosophy, biology, computer science, mathematics, trying to figure out the fundamental structure. That is the goal. And especially if we can contribute to the education of lower-income students, first-generation students, underrepresented groups in these fields, that would be great. To give someone a chance to pursue these slightly impractical kinds of career paths is what we're trying to do. $10,000, a lot of money, but it could change somebody's life. So anyway, Deepti says... What about setting up a scholarship foundation to encourage students to study physics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, et cetera.

Don't ask more than one priority question. There's an interesting question. I'm sorry, Murray, that I'm delaying your answer, but it will eventually come. I wonder about the game theory of this, right? A lot of people ask priority questions right away, but I would think, at least if I'm just a completely self-interested person doing the game theory of it, what I would first try to do is ask the question not labeling it a priority question, and then maybe I will answer it. I'm using the pronoun I in different senses there, but I hope you knew what it meant. I would... If I were the asker, I would ask the question and see whether the podcaster, me, would answer it without labeling it priority. So then you save your priority question for later. And if it doesn't get answered, then you can label it priority, right? As far as I can tell, no one does that. Maybe that's just because you're all too good hearted. Maybe it's because you're not all very good game theorists. I'm not quite sure what the answer is. Anyway, Murray's question is, I pride myself on being a good Bayesian and I apply Bayesian nets professionally. However, a philosophical issue has occurred to me. A good Bayesian update beliefs based on evidence. Doesn't that require that the Bayesian has to be 100% confident in the evidence?

Virtually all the accounting scholarship on information relies either explicitly or implicitly on Bayesian style analysis. While this approach has been fruitful in yielding some qualitative results, this lack of crisp quantitative experimental evidence and the lack of a model of information processing information processing costs has greatly limited our progress. In an attempt to come at our issues from a new direction, we have been studying quantum information, superposition, entanglement, density matrices, etc. We are unclear about the relationship between quantum information models and Bayesian ones. There are two sides to this issue. Number one, Does there always exist a Bayesian-type model with a classical phase space, a priori distribution, and Bayesian updating that it could explain any experimental results that could be explained within a quantum information model?
