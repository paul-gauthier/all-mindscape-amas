None of the places I have been have thought of their students as customers. And in fact, I don't know how people envision what actually happens in universities, but But to a very large extent, faculty members do whatever they want. Faculty members teach the courses they want, or at least maybe the department, which is their other faculty members, assigns them certain courses to teach, but they do so using the texts that they want, giving the exams that they want, handing out the grades they want, etc. There's always one or two stories that get attention of like, oh, this person was fired because they're a tough grader or something like that. But Or, you know, on the other side of things, like these people were giving passing grades to all the players on the basketball team or the football team or something like that. So there's these stories about that. But it's very, very far away from representative of what typically happens. You know, I've been teaching courses, taught two courses last semester. No one in my department knows what grades I gave or what texts I used or anything like that. The faculty, individual faculty, have enormous autonomy in this area. this kind of situation. So I don't know. I don't know what impact it has had other places, on other people, etc. I look at the relationship between students and faculty as kind of a complicated, nuanced thing. The students are paying to get an education, and they're sort of putting the responsibility in the hands of the professors to put them in a position to get that education. And at the end of the day, it's the student's responsibility to take advantage of that position that they're put in. You cannot force people to learn. Some people, like, why do people cheat, right? If you thought that the goal of being at a university was to be educated, to learn things, cheating on exams or papers is completely counterproductive. You are not forcing yourself to learn the things that you learn. Of course, there are many, many students whose goal at university is not to get an education, but it to get a credential. They want to go to medical school or law school or just get a job or whatever. Fortunately for me, those students are not ones that I interact with very much.

So I went to read up on frame-dragging, and that led to the lens-turning procession and references to gravido-magnetic and gravido-electric potentials, terms I hadn't encountered before.
