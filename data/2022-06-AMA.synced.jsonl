You brought an example of a low entropy state as a triangle of billiard balls set up on a table and of a high entropy state as all these same balls after they're hit by the cue ball. Judea objected to it by saying that the difference here, the only difference here, is in the eyes of the beholder. We humans understand and recognize triangles, but we don't recognize the pattern created by the cue ball, but that's not a substantial difference. You objected, but I'm not sure I understood your argument as to why a triangle is indeed a low entropy state versus some other random configuration. Okay, that's one question. Matt Rappaport says, in the Judea Pearl discussion, you discuss the pool table with the balls racked in triangle, blah, blah, blah. If there are x possible configurations of all the balls, isn't the probability of the triangle configuration and the probability of the dispersed configuration both just 1 over x? I'm not clear on how or why entropy has increased. S.P. Sheridan says, I very much enjoyed the Mindscape interview with Jay Pearl, but I was surprised that he was not aware of the forward arrow of time being connected with increasing entropy. I was even more perplexed that he disagreed with you on that a person could tell simply by watching a movie on a billiard board table if a cue ball breaking a triangle of billiard balls was being run forward or backward in time?
