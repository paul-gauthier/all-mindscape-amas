I'm sorry they're long questions. Hopefully we can keep them in mind, but you'll see they're vaguely along the same topic. So David Rabinovitz says, \"'When you interviewed Judea Pearl, he seemed to argue he saw macroscopic states such as billiard ball arrangements as a fundamentally subjective concept. You have generally leaned against this idea with the counter that macro states are not arbitrary but rather are constrained by the laws of physics.' But when Stephen Wolfram claimed that broad conceptions of possible agents leave an enormous scope for what a macrostate might be, you seem to sympathize in part. So the question is, do you have more precise views on what constitutes the most relevant and useful physical constraints upon observers choosing microstates? Maybe you meant macrostates, I'm not sure. And how important is it to understand these constraints to understand entropy and emergence? Then Henry Jacob says, I recently listened to the Judea Pearl interview on causality and he asked you about time reversibility and billiards. You mentioned coarse graining and stat mech to illustrate how an arrow of time emerges. Pearl felt that the way coarse graining was done introduces a choice and is therefore not fundamental. However, you held yourself back from responding other than saying you felt as if the arrow was fundamental. Can you elaborate here? Okay, so I think these are more or less the same question. But then there's another question from Jim Murphy saying, I was listening to old AMA episodes, and you had a good response to my question about complexity in cellular automata. You explained that the automata would need to start with some low entropy state in order to see complexity emerge. What's interesting is that for any particular set of rules, the states that constitute low entropy may look very different.
