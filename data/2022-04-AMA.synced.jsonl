In one view, the differences between our theories of physics in, say, 1,000 years and 5,000 years should be relatively similar, assuming, of course, we continue to make steady progress. On the other view, our theories of physics in 1,000 years and 5,000 years will be radically incomprehensibly different because the growth of knowledge has no cutoff even in any specific field.

And I think that some people loved it and some people hated it, which is more or less, I guess, what I should have expected. But I'm thankful to the people who loved it. Because of your well-articulated explanations, I'm about 70-20 on the side of many worlds' interpretations.

I fear I can't truly take sides or understand the theories to the greatest extent possible without the math. And when I look at the equation, I'm completely lost.
