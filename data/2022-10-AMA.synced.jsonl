I'm just reading the simple harmonic oscillator part, where you start with a ball rolling on a frictionless parabolic valley. But by equation 3.8, you jump to talking about oscillating particles and state that the initial velocity will depend on the mass of the particle represented by the oscillator. You could relate it to the initial position and potential by thinking about energy conservation. In our ball in the valley system, the maximum speed reached at the\u2014okay, I'm not going to read the whole question. It's kind of hard to keep in your mind unless you've read the book. The point is I can give the answer very, very quickly. I'm just trying to help out the book readers here. There's a section in the book where I talk about a ball rolling on a hill. And if it's literally a ball rolling literally on a hill, you calculate the potential energy in terms of the height of the hill. And there's a formula for the potential energy. The potential energy is the mass of the ball times the height of the hill times the acceleration due to gravity, mgh. I got the order of those wrong, but you know what I mean. h is the height, g is the acceleration, m is the mass of the particle. And then the kinetic energy is 1 half mv squared, So the total energy has just an overall factor of m out there, and it actually turns out not to matter. So that's where the origin of this question is coming from. Why should it depend on the mass? But very often, physicists will change variables to something more convenient. So rather than writing mgh, mass acceleration to gravity height, they will just write v of x. OK, so they're absorbing the mass and the acceleration due to gravity times the height into one thing called the potential at every point. And then the potential energy at every point itself doesn't depend on the mass, OK, because we absorbed it. in there. So when you're writing in terms of those variables, you cannot simply take out the mass from the whole thing and treat it as an irrelevant external parameter. It will enter into your equations. So you can choose to do it that way or not. It's up to you. But depending on which variables you use, the answer will or will not depend on the mass in some way.", "fingerprint": "ODQyicgKEh4tA2bJWyinMGjBNYoaNmSZi5G4um5SWFjkDdJI6ipD1C558lTFYFFgULlYrck7Of5TGUZcPwOhKOTit6wVZdwpsdtId6ZnNDTAAAEbj3M0xENQBiocBrBqHNKPk+u1Qh6gxpmhqLLjKhBqQt5PPuioRy5yf/GZDu0="}
